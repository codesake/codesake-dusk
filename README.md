# Codesake::Dusk - the end of web applications security issues

dusk is a dynamic analysis tool for websites to spot security issues. It borns
from a bunch of ruby code snippets I wrote to automate my daily job, so I
gather them together in the hope you'll find them useful too.

## YADAST?

Security market is full of both commercial than opensource dynamic testing
